1. done
2. insert took 884 ms and append took 4 ms
3.
Tiny: insert:6.7 microseconds append 6.6 microseconds (10 items)
Small: 17.9, 10.3 (100 items)
Medium: 155.6, 61.6 (1000 items)
Large: 8.9 ms, 1 ms (10000 items)
extremely large: 884 ms, 4 ms (100000 items)

4. insert is closer to O(n) and append is more like O(ln(n)), the items in
each list is multiplying by ten each list. insert seems more multiplied by a similar amount
where as append speed is minimumly affected

5. insert unshifts is putting it at the beginning forcing everthing else to move an index
    append pushes it at the end so it's pretty fast
